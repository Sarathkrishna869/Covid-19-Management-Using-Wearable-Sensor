    (main() , Get_Details() ,as well as the required variables for the function. ).
•	while getting input checking whether all inputs are valid.
    (Check_Choice() , Check_Temperature(),Check_Cough(cough) Check_Location(location) ,as well as the required variables for the function. ).
•	Based on the standard temperature score(patient temp. and cough) display whether patient has high/medium/low/no symptoms. And suggest necessary remedial measures.    Show_Remedials() ,as well as the required variables for the function.)
•	After each day display the patient records collected.
    (show_details() ,as well as the required variables for the function.)
•	Shows number of patients with high, medium or low probabilities in each location including all the days.
